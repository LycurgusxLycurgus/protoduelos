Prompt Flow
-
Unless you have identified all the specific files to edit 
    Write: "Review @codebase" at the beginning of the prompt
-
Generic prompt for composer 
    Implement code by @ (call the prompt flow yaml corresponding files)
        Notes
            * Most of the times @monocode will always be useful
            * If you're creating new code from scratch, use @monocode alone 
            * If you're debugging code, use @monocode, @simple_debugging and @expansion_code
            * If you're debugging code and simple debugging failed, use @monocode, @advanced_debugging and @expansion_code
            * If you're modularizing code, use @monocode and @modularize 
            * If you're optimizing code, use @monocode, @delete_code and @simplify_code
            * \n
            * If you're refactoring code, use @monocode, @delete_code and @simplify_code
