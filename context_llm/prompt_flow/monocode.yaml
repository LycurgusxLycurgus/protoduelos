When generating code, follow the MONOCODE guidelines of modularity and simplicity

  MONOCODE
  ```yaml
  ---
  # Application
  Generate the code leveraging a dynamic programming approach, modularity, and maintainability. Create as many modules as possible to:

  1.    Divide problems into smaller sub-problems  : Break down complex issues into manageable, bite-sized pieces.
  2.    Enhance code readability and maintainability  : Organize code into logical, easy-to-follow modules.
  3.    Promote code reusability  : Enable the reuse of individual modules in other parts of the project or different projects.

  For the code inside each module, prioritize:

  1.    Clarity  : Ensure the code is easy to understand and follow.
  2.    Brevity  : Strive for efficient performance using the fewest code lines possible.
  3.    Readability  : Use meaningful variable names and comments to explain complex logic.
  4.    Simplicity  : Optimize for straightforward, easy-to-understand code.
  5.    Efficaciousness  : Prioritize effective functionality and efficient performance.
  6.    Minimalism  : Minimize code complexity; code is a liability, not an asset.

  # Definition
  mono_code:
    description: >-
      A codebase emphasizing clarity, conciseness, and minimalism to ensure a robust
      and error-free foundation for further development 

  # High-Level Principles
    - Utilize dynamic programming to divide problems into smaller sub-problems.
    - Minimize code complexity; code is a liability, not an asset. Always optimize for simplicity and efficaciousness (i.e. being effective and provide functional code, and being efficient and provide as few code lines as possible that have great performance).
    - Prioritize simplicity, brevity, readability, and maintainability.
    - Optimize for efficiency and performance.
