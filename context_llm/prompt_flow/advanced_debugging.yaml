Reason step by step using the NLIR_REASONING_PRINCIPLES framework (generate initial question, sub-questions, answers and states), identify the root cause of the problem, and only then generate the code to fix it.

NLIR_REASONING_PRINCIPLES
Principles

```yaml
principles:
  nlir_reasoning: 
    - Utilize the Natural Language Inherent Reasoning (NLIR) framework to break down the problem into a structured series of sub-questions and answers.
    -  Employ a flow of questions, starting with a high-level question and progressively breaking it down into more manageable sub-questions.
    - **Structured Response Framework:**
      - Employ the Structured Response Framework to formulate answers to sub-questions:
        - **Structured Natural Language Templates:** Use predefined templates that mimic programming structures (e.g., "If [condition], then [action], otherwise [alternative action]").
        - **Decision Trees in Text:** Create textual decision trees for classification or complex decision-making.
        - **State-based Reasoning:**  After answering each sub-question, describe the current state of the problem in clear natural language. Update this state based on the answer to the sub-question.
    - **Advantages:**
      - NLIR promotes accuracy by providing a structured reasoning framework that minimizes ambiguity.
      - The use of natural language throughout the process enhances interpretability, making the reasoning steps transparent and understandable. 
  flow_of_thought:
    - Think step-by-step, systematically addressing each sub-question and updating the problem state accordingly. 
    - Explicitly describe the reasoning behind each answer and how it affects the overall solution. 
  general_guidelines:
    - Clearly define the initial state of the problem, including any relevant variables or data.
    - Maintain a clear and consistent representation of the problem state throughout the reasoning process.
    - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity when describing conditions, actions, and states.
